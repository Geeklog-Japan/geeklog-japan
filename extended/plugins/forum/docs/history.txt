  Re-Sync feature to update the new fields

  the $_IMAGE_TYPE. If the image is not found, then it will use the 2nd option 
  as defined in the plugins/forum/config.php - default to 'gif'. This allows a 
  site to have some png images and some gif images and not have to edit the templates
- The links that are used for items like [subscribe], [print], [new topic] ... 
  and the ones that are shown in a topic like the member [profile], [website],[email] 
  can now easily be themed to use a choice of images, basic links or rollover like CSS button. 
  Each link has it's own template under the template forum/layout/links subfolder. 
  I have commented a few and also created a couple CSS Button examples in the 
  Have a look at layout/links/rollover_examples Have a look at print.thtml - and

------------  

Introduced a new admin navbar that will be used in other plugins from Portalparts. 
There is now a new lib-portalparts.php file that needs to be copied to the 
geeklog-dir/system directory. I have placed a set of common functions that will 
be used by this and other portalparts plugins and it does not make sense to be 
including this code with each plugin and trying to maintain updates.
